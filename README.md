# Show Pressed Keys

This is a fork off <a href="https://github.com/denolfe/show-pressed-keys">Denolfe Version</a>

This is primalry intended for use on League Of Legends, as asked for by a friend.

This script will show the  currently pressed keys (as long as they are Q, W, E, R).
 Drawn using GDI+ lib. Intended for use when streaming on Twitch.tv or for Youtube.com.

This project contains scripts:
